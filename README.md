# Derivative-Free Domain-Informed Data-Driven Discovery of Sparse Kinetic Models

This project is based on our paper (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.iecr.4c02981)

## Features

- Integral formulation of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)
- Domain information such as mass balance and stoichiometric information constraint chemical reaction network discovery
